For the Gale Warning, northwest\nwinds 20 to 30 kt with gusts up to 35 kt and waves 7 to 10\nfeet expected. For the Small Craft Advisory, west winds 20 to\n25 kt with gusts up to 35 kt and waves 6 to 9 feet occurring.\n\n* WHERE...Ontonagon to Upper Entrance of Portage Canal MI and\nBlack River to Ontonagon MI.\n\n* WHEN...For the Heavy Freezing Spray Warning, from 1 PM EST\n/noon CST/ this afternoon to 10 AM EST /9 AM CST/ Wednesday.\nFor the Gale Warning, until 4 AM EST /3 AM CST/ Wednesday. For\nthe Small Craft Advisory, until 7 AM EST /6 AM CST/ this\nmorning.\n\n* IMPACTS...Operating a vessel in heavy freezing spray is\nhazardous. Freezing spray may render mechanical and electronic\ncomponents inoperative. Rapid ice accretion on decks and\nsuperstructures may result in a catastrophic loss of\nstability. Strong winds will cause hazardous waves which could\ncapsize or damage vessels and reduce visibility.",
